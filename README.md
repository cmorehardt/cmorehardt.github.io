# Chandler's GIS Portfolio
I am a part-time student at Colorado Mountain College pursuing a GIS Advanced Certificate. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Structural Engineering from Cal Poly (2013) and have worked as an engineer, recruiter, and summer camp director since graduating. I learned about GIS through my work as an engineering recruitment consultant and figured it would be a great way to turn my passion for maps into a career. 
## GIS 101 Final project
I created a map for my current employer - Adventure Unlimited (aka A/U Ranches). I am a camp director for an 1,100 acre camp in Buena Vista, CO. We have a network of trails on property that guests are always getting lost on. I decided to use data from my Strava account as well as collaborating with our in-house forestry team to create a map that more accurately shows our trail network for hikers, bikers, runners, and horseback riders.

## Political Signs in Buena Vista
I mapped the political signs around Buena Vista, CO, using ArcGIS Collector, a month before the 2020 Election to see if they are an accurate prediction of how Chaffee County will vote for both the national and local election.

## 100 Elk Outdoor Center - school diversity 
100 Elk Outdoor Center is an outdoor education program that is part of the organization I work for (Adventure Unlimited in Buena Vista, CO). 100 Elk hosts schools from Colorado and New Mexico in the spring and fall to come up and play in the mountains while taking lessons learned outside back to the classroom. The goal is this project is to map the schools that come to 100 Elk and analyze things like: What is the average income for each school district? What is the racial diversity of each school?
